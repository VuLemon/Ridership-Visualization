THIS FOLDER WILL CONTAIN THE FINAL PARQUET FILES FOR BOTH PROCESSED DATA AND RAW DATA

1. The raw data will contain 4 fields: 
 |-- time: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |-- station_id: string (nullable = true)
 |-- avg(availability): double (nullable = true)
 |-- avg(HourlyDryBulbTemperature): double (nullable = true)

These are the data fields upon joining the 2 weather and bike datasets. I want to keep a copy to verify that the 2 datasets are joined successfully, and to refer back to the raw data for easy debugging in the future

2. The cleaned data will contain 5 fields:
 |-- avg(availability): double (nullable = true)
 |-- temperature_scaled: vector (nullable = true)
 |-- hour_vec: vector (nullable = true)
 |-- weekday_vec: vector (nullable = true)
 |-- station_vec: vector (nullable = true)

 The temperature is scaled using MinMaxScaling (0-1). 
 The weekday and the hour is derived from the timestamp, and is considered categorical features, which is one-hot encoded
 The station id is also categorical features, which is one-hot encoded
