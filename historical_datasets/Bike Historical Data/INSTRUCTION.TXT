THIS FOLDER WILL CONTAIN THE HISTORICAL CITI BIKE DATA TO BE USED FOR ML TRAINING

Populate this file with citi_bike_data. Source can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rosenthal/citi-bike-stations/data. Unarchive, then place the datasets in here
Note: The dataset is missing some data from 2016 to 2019. I have decided to leave it as is, and find weather data from 2019 to 2021. Upon joining tables, the missing data will naturally be excluded
